       Instructions on using NetconfX
       ==============================

0. It is assumed that the system already has the following:
   - The Java SE SDK. NetconfX has been tested with
     JDK version 1.6, but lower versions might work.
   - Apache ANT. NetconfX has been tested with Ant 1.8, but
     lower versions should work, too.

1. Download the NetconfX sources and unzip them into some source folder - e.g.
       /NetconfX        (*nix)
       C:\Temp\NetconfX (Windows)

2. Set the environment variable that defines where the build artifacts
   end up like so:
     export NETCONFX_BUILD=/NetconfX-build         (*nix)
     set NETCONFX_BUILD=C:\Temp\netconfx-build     (Windows)

3. Build the sources to create the distribution. The command for this is
     ant dist                   OR
     ant -Ddebug=true dist     (if you want to debug the resultant code)


  You will get a ZIP file in the ${NETCONF_BUILD} folder that contains:
     |
     -- lib
     |   |
     |   -- NetconfX.jar (JAR file containing NetconfX classes)
     |   |
     |   -- NetconfX_test.jar (JAR file containing NetconfX test classes)
     |
     -- docs
         |
         -- *.pdf (Developer docs)
         |
         -- api
             |
             -- *.html (API Javadocs)


  You can then add "NetconfX.jar" to you application's classpath.
