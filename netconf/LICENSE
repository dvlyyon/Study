       NetconfX Licensing
       ==================

NetconfX is distributed under two separate licensing models:

1. The GNU GPL, which allows you to use NetconfX in any software you develop,
   but restricts you from redistributing NetconfX or any derived work freely.
   Specifically, if your program requires NetconfX (or a derived work) to run,
   then it also must be distributed under the GNU GPL license.

   For more details about the GNU GPL license, see:
     http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

2. A commercial license, which allows you to use NetconfX in your software and
   redistribute its binaries freely, without any restrictions in terms of what
   licensing model your program follows.

   To obtain the commercial license, or for additional details, please contact:
